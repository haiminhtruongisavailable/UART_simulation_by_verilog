# UART_simulation_by_verilog
Designing UART system for transmit and receive data and implementing on FPGA by Verilog HDL

## Project Structure

This project uses a branch-based collaborative system with private workspaces for each team member:

### Branch Organization
- `leader` - Project leader's branch with coordination responsibilities
- `friend1` - Team member 1's development branch
- `friend2` - Team member 2's development branch

### Private Workspace Structure
Each branch contains a private folder (matching the branch name) with the following subfolders:

#### `/leader/`, `/friend1/`, `/friend2/` folders contain:
- **`code/`** - Verilog HDL source files, testbenches, and implementation code
- **`docs/`** - Technical documentation, specifications, and design documents
- **`images/`** - Diagrams, screenshots, waveforms, and visual resources
- **`references/`** - External links, YouTube videos, papers, and reference materials

### Getting Started
1. Switch to your assigned branch:
   - Leader: `git checkout leader-clean`
   - Friend 1: `git checkout friend1-clean` 
   - Friend 2: `git checkout friend2-clean`
2. Work in your private folder: `cd [folder-name]/`
3. Use the subfolders to organize your contributions
4. Document your work and add references as needed

### Available Branches
- **leader-clean** - Contains only `/leader/` workspace for project coordination
- **friend1-clean** - Contains only `/friend1/` workspace for team member 1
- **friend2-clean** - Contains only `/friend2/` workspace for team member 2

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Keep your work organized in your private folder
- Document your code and design decisions
- Share useful resources in the `references/` folder
- Regular commits and descriptive commit messages
- Coordinate with team leader for integration
- Each branch contains only one team member's workspace for privacy
