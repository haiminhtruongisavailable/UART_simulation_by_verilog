# UART_simulation_by_verilog
Designing UART system for transmit and receive data and implementing on FPGA by Verilog HDL

## Project Structure

This project uses a branch-based collaborative system with private workspaces for each team member:

### Branch Organization
- `leader` - Project leader's branch with coordination responsibilities
- `friend1` - Team member 1's development branch
- `friend2` - Team member 2's development branch

### Private Workspace Structure
Each branch contains a private folder (matching the branch name) with the following subfolders:

#### `/leader/`, `/friend1/`, `/friend2/` folders contain:
- **`code/`** - Verilog HDL source files, testbenches, and implementation code
- **`docs/`** - Technical documentation, specifications, and design documents
- **`images/`** - Diagrams, screenshots, waveforms, and visual resources
- **`references/`** - External links, YouTube videos, papers, and reference materials

### Getting Started
1. Switch to your assigned branch: `git checkout [branch-name]`
2. Work in your private folder: `cd [branch-name]/`
3. Use the subfolders to organize your contributions
4. Document your work and add references as needed

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Keep your work organized in your private folder
- Document your code and design decisions
- Share useful resources in the `references/` folder
- Regular commits and descriptive commit messages
- Coordinate with team leader for integration
